API for Generating Service Invoices

- This project is an API that generates service invoices using a SQLite database. The database contains four tables: client, service, invoice, and invoiceline.
- i wanted to include a Template table to generate the invoices in different templates depending on the clinet  but i still working on that 
- This API is secured  Tokens (JWT). To access any of the endpoints, you will need to include a valid token in the Authorization header of your request.
- The following screenshots give a better view of the project (in the 'img' file )

-This project combines two smaller projects that I have been working on. The first is an API that includes endpoints for GET, PUT, DELETE, and UPDATE operations. The second is a simple document generation project that does not use a database.
